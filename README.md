# Data Science Analysis On Real/Fake Job Postings

Since the pandemic, millions of people have lost their jobs and the threat of cybercrime has grown to a concerning degree, driven by the surge in phishing and ransomware. Scammers today are using fake job postings to steal people’s identities; from ads on social media like Facebook and LinkedIn to elaborate recreations of a company’s hiring website, they can be tough to spot by the human eye. My goal for this project is to build reliable classification and clustering models to identify patterns and trends within data that may indicate fraud and protect against identity theft.

<ins>Project Specifics</ins>

- Analyzed 18k real/fake job postings from 2020 with consideration to location, employment type, education, etc. using an end-to-end sci-kit learn workflow: data preprocessing, cross validation, building & fitting models, etc. to predict whether the postings are fraudulent or not and protect against identity theft
- Implemented python packages and techniques Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Label Encoding & Standardization
- Performed Linear Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree & K-Nearest Neigbors Classification algorithms, as well as K-Means & Gaussian Mixture Clustering paired with the Elbow Method & Silhouette Score to determine 'K'
